## Quickstart

* Ensure Python 3 and MPV are installed on your subsystem
* Clone the repository - this will become you main working directory.
* Install python dependencies
* Configure your stations
    * In the confs directory
* Generate a weekly schedule
    * Use `station_42.py`
* Watch TV
    * Use `field_player.py`
* Configure start-on-boot (optional and not recommended unless you are making a dedicated device.)
    * Use `hot_start.sh`

## Install Dependencies
This is the base player component. Any linux installation should work fine (including Rasberry Pi) and it even works with windows subsystem for linux.

* Ensure MPV is installed and operational
* Ensure Python 3 is installed and up-to-date
    * Its recommended that you use a virtual env, but not required.

### Python Dependencies
The following modules are required for the system to work:

#### moviepy
This module is used to determine the duration of a video files when building catalogs - it is not used during scheduling or live play.

`pip3 install moviepy`

#### Python MPV JSONIPC
This module is used to start and control the mpv player during playback over named pipes.

`pip3 install python-mpv-jsonipc`

## Clone Repository

Use the standard github command to clone the repository into a local directory.

## Configuring Stations
For simplicity, configurations are stored as python files in the 'confs' module.

### fieldStation42_conf.py
The main configuration is `confs/fieldStation42_conf.py` and contains the following fields:

stations : array of stations configuration - should be a matching .py file
channel_socket : path to file to use to signal channel changes - save any text to this file and the field_player will change to the next channel.

### Per Channel Configurations
Each channel is a separate python file, as named in `confs/fieldStation42_conf.py`. Example configurations are provided - as in this example for channel named ''
```
station_conf = {
    # basic human readable name for the channel
    'network_name' : "MyChannel",
    # path to the catalog binary file to be stored
    'catalog_path' : "catalog/mychannel_catalog.bin",
    # root directory for content for this station
    'content_dir' : "catalog/mychannel_catalog",
    # runtime dir for this station - where schedules etc will be stored
    'runtime_dir' : "runtime/mychannel",
    # path to output the weekly schedule
    'schedule_path': "runtime/mychannel_schedule.bin",
    # must be inside or linked inside content_dir - these will be used to pad time in the video stream
    'commercial_dir' : "commercial",
    # must be inside or linked inside content_dir - these will be used to pad time in the video stream
    'bump_dir' : "bump",
    # list of directories (tags) intended to be stitched clips vs full content in a single file
    'clip_shows' : ["some_show", "some_clip_show"],
    #used at sign-off time (played once)
    'sign_off_video': "catalog/anthem_signoff.mp4",
    #used when the channel is offair
    'off_air_video': "catalog/off_air_pattern.mp4",
...
```

#### Schedule Configuration
Schedules are configured in the `'monday'` through ``sunday'` elements of station_conf and have the following structure:

```
    'monday': {
        # will play random content from the content/morning path
        7: {'tags': 'morning'},
        # will play random content from the content/morning path
        8: {'tags': 'morning'},
        # will play random content from the content/cartoon path
        9: {'tags': 'cartoon'},
        # will play random content from the content/gameshow path
        10: {'tags' : 'gameshow'},
        11: {'tags' : 'gameshow'},
        12: {'tags' : 'daytime'},
        13: {'tags' : 'daytime'},
        14: {'tags' : 'daytime'},
        15: {'tags' : 'classic'},
        16: {'tags' : 'syndication'},
        17: {'tags' : 'syndication'},
        18: {'tags' : 'news'},
        19: {'tags' : 'gameshow'},
        20: {'tags' : 'sitcom'},
        # since this is a clip show, will stitch random clips from content/some_clip_show
        21: {'tags' : 'some_clip_show'},
        22: {'tags' : 'prime'},
        23: {'tags' : 'news'},
        0: {'tags' : 'late'},
        1: {'tags' : 'late-late'},
        2: {'tags' : 'classic'}
        3: {'event' : 'signoff'}
    },
```
In generalized terms, we use a scheme where the hours number is used as the key and the value points to a 'tag' or path of the form: `content/tag`

### About station runtime directories
This is where each stations schedule will be stored and read from. You will need to create these directories if they do not exist.

### About Station Catalogs
Station catalogs are a binary representation of the video files stored in the stations content directories. When weekly schedules are being created, if a stations does not have a catalog.bin file, one will be created by recursively searching the stations configured `content_dir` for mp4 files. Each video file is inspected for length and other metadata and stored by indexed tags (directory names) in the station's configured `catalog_path`.

*NOTE:* If you update your content, you will need to delete the .bin file noted in the station's configured `catalog_path`

### About Sign Off events
A signoff event is specified by assigning a time slot to `{'event' : 'signoff'}` and will cause the video file specified by `sign_off_video` to be played once at the top of the hour. If `off_air_video` is specified, then the remainder of the hour will be filled by looping `off_air_video`.

### About Off Air time
If a time slot is not specified, it will be considered as off-air for schedule creation. If `off_air_video` is specified, then the slot will be filled by looping `off_air_video`.

## Building Weekly Schedules
Station schedules span Monday-Sunday and are stored in the station's configured `runtime_dir`

To build the schedule, run:

`python3 station_42.py`

This process will load each stations catalog and uses the schedule configuration to build a series of .json files in the station's configured `runtime_dir` of the form `day_hour.json` - for example: saturday_10.json would be the schedule for saturday at 10:00 am. These json files are essentially playlists that relate directly to the `saturday`->`10`; a random video with a low play count from the directory specified by the tag will be picked as the base video. If it is less than 30 minutes long, a second video will be selected from the same directory to round out the hour. Commercials and station bumps cut into playlist to build out to the full hour timeslot. Several different scheduling strategies are used to cut-in commercials and bumps, depending on the amount of time needed to fill. Selected shows have their playcounts incremented so they are less likely to be selected next.

The following shows an example start for an hourly scheduling block. The base video here is `some_cartoon_V1-003.mp4` and it will play for 440 seconds before 3 commercials will come on. Then, `some_cartoon_V1-003.mp4` will be started where it left off and play for 440 seconds, before another commercial break will start.

```
[
    {
        "path": "catalog/mystation_catalog/cartoon/some_cartoon_V1-0003.mp4",
        "start": 0,
        "duration": 440.3
    },
    {
        "path": "catalog/mystation_catalog/commercial/comx00022985.mp4",
        "start": 0,
        "duration": 30.76
    },
    {
        "path": "catalog/mystation_catalog/bump/com00096765.mp4",
        "start": 0,
        "duration": 20.72
    },
    {
        "path": "catalog/mystation_catalog/bump/com00077020.mp4",
        "start": 0,
        "duration": 20.17
    },
    {
        "path": "catalog/mystation_catalog/cartoon/some_cartoon_V1-0003.mp4",
        "start": 440.3,
        "duration": 440.3
    },
    {
        "path": "catalog/mystation_catalog/bump/com00057040.mp4",
        "start": 0,
        "duration": 23.6
    },
...
```

## Starting the player
To start the player, run:

`python3 field_player.py`

It will automatically start playing the scheduled content for the first station configured in `main_config` in `confs/fieldStation42_conf.py`

Note: This will fail if you have not already generated a weekly schedule using `station_42.py`

### Changing the station
To change the channel, just open the file specified by `channel_socket` in `confs/fieldStation42_conf.py` in any text editor and save any text there, the field_player monitors this file and will change to the next station configured in `main_config` in `confs/fieldStation42_conf.py`

## Using hotstart.sh
This file is for use on a running system that has been configured and testing, because it swallows output so you'll never know what's going wrong. This file is intended to be used to start the player running on system boot up.

## Raspberry Pico Setup

This is only required if you are building the channel change detector component (not required).

* Install Circuit Python per their instructions and install dependencies for Neopixels.
* Add the contents of `aerial_listener.py` to `code.py` on the device so that it starts at boot.
